# 🤖 Hybrid RAG System using Knowledge Graph and FAISS

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that combines the strengths of a **Knowledge Graph (KG)** and **unstructured document retrieval (PDFs)** to deliver **accurate, explainable, and hallucination-free answers**.

The system intelligently decides whether a question requires:
- **Exact factual retrieval** from structured data (via Knowledge Graph), or
- **Contextual summarization** from unstructured documents (via RAG).

A local open-source LLM (**LLaMA 3 via Ollama**) is used for answer generation, ensuring privacy and offline capability.

## 🧠 Query Handling Strategy

The system classifies queries into three categories:

### 1️⃣ Fact-Based Queries
Examples:
- *What is the hire date of Employee_1?*
- *What is the salary of Employee_2?*

➡️ Answered directly from **Knowledge Graph**  
➡️ No LLM usage → no hallucination

---

### 2️⃣ Relation-Based Queries
Examples:
- *Who sent the email to chris.germany@enron.com?*

➡️ Resolved using **KG relationship triples**

---

### 3️⃣ Descriptive Queries
Examples:
- *Describe how artificial intelligence is mentioned in Microsoft.*
- *Explain the jobs initiative.*

➡️ Answered using **PDF chunks + LLM summarization**

---

### 🚫 Out-of-Scope Queries
If the information is not present in the data, the system clearly responds:
> *“The information is not available in the provided documents.”*

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AquibAhmadrja/AI-Knowledge-Graph-Builder-For-Enterprises.git
cd Hybrid-RAG-KG-System


Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Ollama (Local LLM)
ollama run llama3

Build FAISS Index (One-Time)
python scripts/create_faiss_index.py

python scripts/build_index.py
streamlit run python_rag/rag_ui.py

📦 Note on FAISS Index & Embeddings

Due to size constraints and best practices:

FAISS indices and embeddings are not stored in GitHub

They are generated locally using the provided build script

This approach ensures:

Clean repository

Reproducibility

Industry-standard workflow

📊 Performance & Accuracy

High precision for factual queries via Knowledge Graph

Contextually grounded descriptive answers via RAG

No hallucinations due to strict prompt enforcement

Confidence indicator shown in UI for user trust

🚀 Future Enhancements

Knowledge Graph visualization in UI

Advanced ML-based query classification

Incremental FAISS updates

Multi-document reasoning

Analytics dashboard for usage insights

🧾 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a robust, scalable, and explainable Hybrid RAG architecture suitable for enterprise-level question answering systems. By combining structured knowledge with unstructured document retrieval, it achieves both accuracy and interpretability, going beyond traditional RAG implementations.
